# Tic Tac Toe
3 IN A ROW!

## What I did
Built a simple game with simple, organized code.

Future Features:
- game logic for win conditions and subsequent announcement: "Player One win!!"
- programmatically block spaces from being changed again
- misc. stylings that feel more weird/fun

## What I learned
1. Factory functions and the module pattern. This stuff is really cool! It's a whole 'nother level of programming that is really exciting to reach. Still hacking at it, but every success feels huge!
2. Using closures and scope and factory functions to do cool stuff.
3. It is far more beneficial to start writing code from the most basic, long-handed way. At this point in my abilities, I need to spend more time understanding the basic functions before jumping to writing the "most elegant" solution. It's just like writing in english. Get that shitty first draft out there, and then refine.
    - As they say, first solve the problem, then refactor!

What a fun project! Games are so great to use to learn how to "think" in a language. I feel like I should be used to it at this point, but I'm still humored by all the little steps that need to be built for even the most meager of games. And let me tell ya, this game is meager as hell. I mean, it won't be. But at this point, things are rough haha. But it's fun!

I think part of the reason I keep hitting walls on this has to do with feeling like building the game to run just in the console at first is completely different than using a UI. Not completely, but I can't help but feel I'm just causing more work for myself.

I tried to keep in mind the advice to first solve the problem, then refactor. And I do believe that holds water. But without incorporating the UI from the start is ignoring a huge facet of the problem. It doesn't help to simplify anything for me. It just feels like an arbitrary constraint. But who knows. I'm such a little baby at this I hardly have the experience to make a call like this.

Regardless of how wrong I am, I'm going to build out the UI for this so my brain has some visuals to latch onto.

Wow, I'm having so much fun busting out this UI! Hahaha, just rapidly setting this thing up is super fun.

I got a little fed up with the core game logic so I had to have some easy fun with the visuals. Feeling much better about this project now. Sort of, refreshed. Making things that will (hopefully) make other people laugh is really motivating. I should remember that.

I learned stuff today!! Woots all around!

Specifically, I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND MODULES AND IIFE'S :D :D :D Learning is fun!
