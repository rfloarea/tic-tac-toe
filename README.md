3 IN A ROW!

## What I did

## What I learned
1. Factory functions and the module pattern. This stuff is really cool! It's a whole 'nother level of programming that is really exciting to reach. Still hacking at it, but every success feels huge!
2. Using closures and scope and factory functions to do cool stuff.

What a fun project! Games are so great to use to learn how to "think" in a language. I feel like I should be used to it at this point, but I'm still humored by all the little steps that need to be built for even the most meager of games. And let me tell ya, this game is meager as hell. I mean, it won't be. But at this point, things are rough haha. But it's fun!

I think part of the reason I keep hitting walls on this has to do with feeling like building the game to run just in the console at first is completely different than using a UI. Not completely, but I can't help but feel I'm just causing more work for myself.

I tried to keep in mind the advice to first solve the problem, then refactor. And I do believe that holds water. But without incorporating the UI from the start is ignoring a huge facet of the problem. It doesn't help to simplify anything for me. It just feels like an arbitrary constraint. But who knows. I'm such a little baby at this I hardly have the experience to make a call like this.

Regardless of how wrong I am, I'm going to build out the UI for this so my brain has some visuals to latch onto.

Wow, I'm having so much fun busting out this UI! Hahaha, just rapidly setting this thing up is super fun.

I got a little fed up with the core game logic so I had to have some easy fun with the visuals. Feeling much better about this project now. Sort of, refreshed. Making things that will (hopefully) make other people laugh is really motivating. I should remember that.
